	<h2>Mentors and Personal Coaching</h2>
	<p>
	Mentors or personal coaches can improve confidence and lead to job opportunities you had not considered.
	Personal coaches can be hired to fill gaps in your experience or ability, perhaps with public speaking,
	prioritising, management and career planning.
	</p>
	<p>
	Perhaps the best option is to find a mentor, although they can be difficult to find. They will be a
	person with lots of experience in your field or a similar area. They must like you and be
	enthusiastic about your career, because they will be doing this for the enjoyment of seeing
	your career grow. A good mentor is a coach, always challenging you, inspiring you and demanding that you
	do your best. They are familiar with a range of professional opportunities and are guides who enjoy helping
	others and love their work. They will also have a large network that will assist you.

<h2>How to Win Friends and Influence People</h2>
<p>
	The book <i>How to win friends and influence people</i> has been influential in business and politics
	for nearly 100 years. It offers brilliantly simple insights into improving all personal relationships,
	perhaps most importantly with clients and customers, which anyone can use.
</p>
<p>
	The author, Dale Carnegie, found he was having trouble selling to some customers, and by
	applying some thought and different approaches, he could be much more successfull. He soon
	realised these techniques could be applied to personal relationships as well, and that there
	was a huge demand from people who wanted to improve some relationships in their business or personal
	lives.
</p>
<p>
	"Dale Carnegie offers practical advice and techniques for how to get out of a mental rut and make life
	more rewarding. His advice has stood the test of time and will teach you how to: make friends quickly
	and easily, increase your popularity, win people to your way of thinking, enable you to win new clients
	and customers and, arouse enthusiasm among your colleagues." (Review in the Guardian)
</p>
<p>
	"It is humanity and deepest sincerity that connects human beings together;
	and if they happen to be seller/buyer then that's just the way things are." (Customer review from Amazon)
