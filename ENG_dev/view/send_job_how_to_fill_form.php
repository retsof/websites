        <h1>How do I fill in the Send Job Form?</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>1. Contact details</h2>

        <p>Your name, organisation, e-mail and telephone number will be handled confidentially. They will not be displayed on our website. We need to have these details so we can contact you in case of any questions about the advertisement.</p>
        <p>You can have an anonyomous job advert if you wish, by using a Gmail or Hotmail account, and using a generic organisation name in your advertisement (such as "a Prestigious Law Firm").</p>

        <h2>2. Organisation details</h2>

        <p>Enter your organisation&rsquo;s name, and your organisation&rsquo;s website address.</p>

        <h2>3. Job details</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Enter the Job Ad URL - the web address of this job on your website if possible. Copy from the browser - it will be something like www.yourco.com/job.</li>
            <li>Enter the Job Title - this is the job title which is what is displayed in our listings. Do not enter more than one job title. Contact us for information if this job ad contains multiple job titles.</li>
            <li>Job Description - paste in your job details, including how to apply for the job.  If you have written the job advertisement as a Word document, you can select all the text and paste into the Job Description field. You can't specify exact formatting. We will layout your job ad using our own styling, although we will normally follow your use of bullet points and titles. For standard and high visibility ads, you can email us a Word document which we will convert for you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Billing details</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Billing entity and address - please enter your organisation's full legal name and the postal address to put on our invoice. Include the person (or department) who should receive the bill.</li>
            <li> The VAT number (sales tax number) is important - without it we will have to charge you VAT, as required by tax authorities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. More Information</h2>

        <p>Tick if you want more information on any of our related products. We will get back to you quickly with further details and assistance.</p>

        <h2>6. Send Logo and Order the Job</h2>

        <p>If you are a new customer, please email us a logo so we can use this in our job listings. If you prefer we can usually produce a logo from your website.</p>
        <p>Read our brief Terms and Conditions, tick to say you have read them and you agree to the price displayed, then press &ldquo;Order Job&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>We will then process your job, and standard and high visibility jobs are usually online within 2 hours. Basic jobs are usually processed during the following day. You will receive an invoice by email in a few days.</p>
