  <h1>Selecting the right candidate</h1>
  <br>

  <h2>Short-listing and interviewing</h2>

  <p>
	Drawing up a shortlist means cutting through the pile of applicants until you have a selection of candidates that you would like to request for interview. Unfortunately people often apply for jobs that they are obviously under-qualified for.
  </p>
  <p>
	When you contact prospective interviewees, provide clear instructions covering:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>date and time of the interview</li>
    <li>where you are located and how to get there</li>
    <li>who they should ask for</li>
    <li>how long the interview is likely to last</li>
    <li>what they should bring with them</li>
    <li>whether they will be reimbursed for travel expenses</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h2>Interview technique</h2>

  <p>
Interviewers often have a number of set questions which they ask every candidate. These questions are based around the requirement of the job, and by asking the same questions, they can draw a direct comparison between each candidate.
<br>
  <ul>
    <li>The interviewer should ask questions, which are open, for example how, when, what, why etc. giving the candidate the opportunity to answer fully, rather than responding with a simple 'yes' or 'no'</li>
    <li>Avoid interrupting the answers or leading them in any direction</li>
    <li>Summarise the responses back to the candidate, before making notes, to ensure that you have fully understood</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <p>
	Normally the interviewer shouldn't be tempted to talk too much to fill any potentially uncomfortable moments of silence. The silence can from the interviewers point of view be a very effective way of encouraging the candidate to offer up more information.
  </p>

  <p>
	Interviewers must remember that what appears to be a more informal chat than a 'grilling' tends to put a candidate at ease to get a more honest response. This gives valuable insight into the candidate's personality traits, rather than simply an understanding of their skills and experience.
  </p>

  <p>
The recruiter should remember to notice the body language of the candidate:
  <ul>
    <li>The initial hand-shake and introduction reveals a lot of a person</li>
    <li>So does the seating position, body language, gesticulation and of eye contact</li>
  </ul>
