		"any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
		person" such as name, address, e-mail, unique identifier, etc. The
		personal data we process is either provided directly by you on a voluntary
		basis or collected automatically via the Site.

	<h2>1.1. Personal Data You Provide To Us on a Voluntary Basis</h2>
	<p>
		You may choose to provide personal data. The personal data that you provide to us via
		this Site is never obligatory, unless marked otherwise. If you choose
		not to give some data, this may affect the way you navigate on this
		Site or the services that we can offer you. Here are the ways you may
		provide the data, the type of personal data you may provide and how
		we may use the data.
	</p>
	
	<ul type="DISC">
	  <li>
		  <u>Posting of job vacancies</u>: As a recruiter, you may post job vacancies on
		  our Site by using the recruit section. If you decide to use our service
		  to recruit professionals, we ask for personal data such as your name,
		  e-mail address, telephone number, the name of your organization, billing
		  address, etc. This personal data will mainly be used for billing purposes.

	<h2>1.2. Personal Data We Collect Automatically</h2>
	<p>
		Like many companies,
		<?php echo WEBSITENAME ?> uses cookies and log files to enhance your visit to our
		Site and to better understand how our Site is used. Log files are web
		server files that are automatically created when a user visits a site.
		Cookies are small text files that websites often place on the computer
		hard drives of visitors to their sites. A cookie contains a unique code,
		which is used to recognize your computer when a user from your computer
		returns to a website that was visited previously.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you want to stop the cookie function of your browser, the “Help” portion
		of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting
		new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how
		to disable existing cookies.  If you reject our cookies you may
		still use this Site, but you may be limited in the use of some of its
		features and may not be able to take full advantage of all of our Site
		features.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Some of our affiliates or owners of websites that link to this Site may also use
		cookies, however, we have no access to, or control over these cookies
		and do not accept any responsibility for such use.
	</p>
	<br><h1>2. Personal Data We Share</h1>
	<p>
		We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal data about our Site visitors,
		except as described here.  When you provide us with personal data
		through this Site, you authorize us to use that personal data for the
		indicated purposes.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may share your personal data with potential recruiters. Recruiters will have access
		to our candidates database remotely. We contractually require the potential
		recruiters to keep the data secure and not to use them for other purposes
		than recruitment purposes. Once contacted by a potential recruiter,
		please see their privacy policy for more information about their privacy
		practices. Additionally, we may provide these potential recruiters with
		aggregated information (generic information on users of our services)
		about the performance of the Site such as the number of visitors, their
		country of residence, age, gender and language preferences.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may also share your personal data with service providers we have retained to
		perform various services on our behalf and in relation to the purposes
		set forth in this Privacy Policy.  These service providers are
		contractually required to act only on our instructions and to maintain
		an appropriate level of data protection and data security. Service providers
		are not authorized by us to use the data for their own purposes or to
		disclose the data to third parties except as necessary to perform services
		or functions for <?php echo WEBSITENAME ?> or to comply with legal requirements.
		For example, service providers are not authorized by <?php echo WEBSITENAME ?> to
		use the data for their own marketing purposes.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We may disclose
		data about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or pursuant to
		Court order, or (ii) in response to a legitimate request from law enforcement
		authorities. We also reserve the right to transfer any data we have
		about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business
		or assets.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable
		efforts to try to require that the transferee uses personal data you
		have provided through this Site in a manner that is consistent with
		this Privacy Policy.  If you do not want the transferee to further
		process your data in such case, you should contact the transferee.
	</p>

		You have the
		right to receive information about the personal data stored about you
		and to access your personal data by using the contact information provided
		below in the <a href="<?php echo $_SERVER[PHP_SELF]?>#section10">“How to Contact Us”</a> section.

		<?php echo WEBSITENAME ?> mainly collects, processes and uses your personal data within the European
		Union. If we transfer your personal data outside of the European Union

		Union, we take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with applicable
		data protection law, in particular the legal requirements on adequate
		protection for data transfers to countries outside of the European Union.
	</p>
	
	<br><h1>5. Records Retention </h1>
	<p>
		<?php echo WEBSITENAME ?> only retains personal data for as long as needed to fulfill the purposes
		for which they were collected, unless otherwise provided by law.
		When the data is no longer necessary to meet the purposes for which
		it was collected, it is deleted, blocked or anonymized.
	</p>
	
	<br><h1>6. Links to Other Sites</h1>
	<p>
		We provide links to other non-<?php echo WEBSITENAME ?> websites for your convenience and information.
		These sites operate independently and are not affiliated with <?php echo WEBSITENAME ?>
		nor are under our control.  These sites may have their own privacy
		policies in place, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit
		any linked websites.
	</p>
	
	<br><h1>7. Security</h1>
	<p>
		We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect
		personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental
		loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse,
		and all other unlawful forms of processing of the personal data in our
		possession.
	</p>
	
	<br><h1>8. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>
		We may change or update portions of this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior
		notice to you. Please check back from time to time so you are aware
		of any changes or updates to the Policy. In case of substantial changes
		to the Privacy Policy, we will, however, post a notice on the homepage
